# Nmap & Scapy Practical Lab

## Overview
This repository documents practical cybersecurity labs focused on network reconnaissance and packet manipulation. The objective was to master Nmap for host discovery and service enumeration, and Scapy for custom packet crafting and sniffing.

## Prerequisites
* **Kali Linux** (Virtual Machine)
* **Nmap** installed
* **Python** with **Scapy** library installed
* Root/Sudo privileges

## Part 1: Nmap (Network Mapper)
**Objective:** Perform host discovery, OS fingerprinting, and service detection on the target network `10.6.6.0/24`.



## Part 2: Scapy (Packet Manipulation)
Objective: Use Scapy's interactive shell to sniff network traffic and analyze packets programmatically.
